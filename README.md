# WVR BINARIES

In each folder is all the released firmware versions for each WVR board.

The version code uses semantic versioning standards. A major version (1.x.x -> 2.x.x) update will trigger a full eMMC reset the first time it is booted.

Each firmware is compiled against the same version number of the WVR Arduino library, which is tagged using the version number. The .zip files for all these Arduino Libraries are available here https://github.com/marchingband/wvr/releases under **assets** WVR.zip
