# WVR BINARIES

In each folder is all the released firmware versions for each WVR board.

The version code uses semantic versioning standards. A major version (1.x.x -> 2.x.x) update will trigger a full eMMC reset the first time it is booted.

The latest release (highest number) will always correspond to the current version of the WVR Arduino library. The readme for each version will tell you which version of the Arduino library it was compiled from. The .zip files for all these Arduino Libraries are available as github 'Releases' in the marchingband/wvr repo.
